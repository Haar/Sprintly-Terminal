Sly
=================

Project to create a `nice` terminal interface for the Sprint.ly task management tool.

### Testing

'Unfortunately', testing of the Sly 'connector' requires a Sprint.ly account - then again, why would you be touching this if you didn't have an account in the first place? :P

To run the suite of tests, simply use the standard `rake` command.
